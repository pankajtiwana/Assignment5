     * Exercise #2 - Retail Price Calculator
     * 
     * Write a program that asks the user to enter an item's wholesale cost and 
     * its markup percentage. It should then display the item's retail price. 
     * For example:
     *   - If an item's wholesale cost is 5.00 and its markup percentage is 100 
     *       percent, then the item's retail price is 10.00.
     *   - If an item's wholesale cost is 5.00 and its markup percentage is 50 
     *       percent, then the item's retail price is 7.50.
     * The program should reference a method named calculateRetail that receives 
     * the wholesale cost and the markup percentage as arguments, and returns 
     * the retail price of the item.

     *     C = (5.0/9.0) * (F - 32)
     * Where F is the Fahrenheit temperature and C is the Celsius temperature. 
     * Write a method named celsius that accepts a Fahrenheit temperature as an 
     * argument. The method should return the temperature, converted to Celsius. 
     * Demonstrate the method by calling it in a loop that displays a table of 
     * the Fahrenheit temperatures 0 through 20 and their Celsius equivalents.

     * Exercise #13 - isPrime Method

     * A prime number is a number that is evenly divisible only by itself and 1.

     * by 1 and 5. The number 6, however, is not prime because it can be divided 
     * evenly by 1, 2, 3, and 6.
     * Write a method named isPrime, which takes an integer as an argument and 
     * returns true if the argument is a prime number, or false otherwise.
